Hi, I'm Maddie! I created the Takes & Tastes app for my friends after getting years of joy, laughter, and connection out of the paper and pen version. I got tired of asking bartenders for receipt paper and carrying pens in my bag. I hope you enjoy playing and getting to know each other better!

I used to be a software engineer and am now fulfilling a childhood dream of traveling by sailboat. If you'd like to support my work you can [buy me a coffee](https://coff.ee/madelinezu5). Thank you for being here!
